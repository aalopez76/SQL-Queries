# SQL Queries: From Fundamental to Advanced

A complete SQL portfolio project: descriptive, analytical, diagnostic, predictive & structural analysis.

### Project Background

This project analyzes the operational and commercial performance of Toys & Models Co., a global distributor of collectible cars, motorcycles, planes, and scale models.

The company operates in the wholesale/retail hobbyist industry and has been active for over 20 years, serving customers across North America, Europe, and APAC. Its business model revolves around:

-Selling scale-model products (cars, planes, ships, motorcycles)
-Managing customer orders & payments
-Distributing inventory worldwide from regional offices
-A B2B commercial structure (customers have assigned sales representatives)
-Product-centric revenue driven by seasonal demand

From the perspective of a data analyst, this project evaluates:

-Sales performance
-Customer behavior
-Product demand patterns
-Operational quality & data integrity
-- Organizational structure
-- Forecasting-ready datasets

Insights and recommendations are provided on four key areas:

- Category 1: Customer & Geographic Insights
- Category 2: Product & Sales Performance
- Category 3: Operational Quality & Data Integrity
- Category 4: Employee & Organizational Structure

This project focuses on identify trends, opportunities, and operational bottlenecks through structured SQL analysis to provide a comprehensive overview of the *Toys & Models* company operations.  

The database contains detailed information about employees, products, orders, customers, and payments — forming a realistic business ecosystem suitable for relational data modeling and advanced SQL querying.

### Project Summary

The goal of this project is to extract, and analyze key business insights by progressing from fundamental SQL operations to advanced analytical queries 

Each stage of the workflow builds upon the previous one:

1. **Database Connection**  
   A modular, Object-Oriented (OOP) connection layer is implemented to support multiple database engines (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).  
   This abstraction enables flexible and reusable interaction with diverse data sources.  
   The class definitions and credential configuration can be reviewed in the repository’s `SQL-Connection` module.

2. **Desciptive Queries**
3. **Analytical Queries**
4. **Diagnostic Queries**
5. **Predictive or Feature-Support Queries**
6. **Structural/Organizacional Queries**
