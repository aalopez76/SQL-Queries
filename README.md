### Project Summary

The goal of this project is to extract, and analyze key business insights by progressing from fundamental SQL operations to advanced analytical queries 

Each stage of the workflow builds upon the previous one:

1. **Database Connection**  
   A modular, Object-Oriented (OOP) connection layer is implemented to support multiple database engines (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).  
   This abstraction enables flexible and reusable interaction with diverse data sources.  
   The class definitions and credential configuration can be reviewed in the repository’s `SQL-Connection` module.

2. **Desciptive Queries**
3. **Analytical Queries**
4. **Diagnostic Queries**
5. **Predictive or Feature-Support Queries**
6. **Structural/Organizacional Queries**
